	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p1>In this lab I learned how to create a local file structure. I also learned how to link local files like images and other html files to my website.</p1>
	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<p2>For the most part creating the file structure was easy. I had a little bit of trouble linking my labs to my home page. But, I began to understand the way the file path worked and had not problem after that.</p2>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p3>Here is a screenshot of the file sctructure:</p3>
